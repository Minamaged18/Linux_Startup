1-Script Structure:

The script is well-structured with clear function definitions for each setup. This makes the code modular and easier to maintain.
Comments are present, which provide context for each function.


2-User Interface:

The main menu is clear and provides users with a straightforward choice.
It's good practice to add some error checking for the user input. For example, if a user enters a non-integer value or something other than 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3-Packages and Tools:

I've included a wide array of tools for both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) activities, which makes the script comprehensive for its intended purpose.


4-Safety and Best Practices





Running scripts that make system-wide changes can be risky. Always backup your data and ensure you're running scripts from trusted sources.
It might be beneficial to add some error handling mechanisms, especially around commands that could potentially fail or halt the script.
Be cautious when using tools and scripts from online repositories. Always review them to understand their functionality and ensure they don't contain malicious code.
